# JARVIS
Welcome to this course! ✌️ 
Together we will dive in the magic world of Python and AI programming.
We will explore exciting concepts of Python and NLP, learn how to use them and
then create the final project. Its concept is to create an AI voice assistant,
exactly like Ironman's J.A.R.V.I.S. ! 💥  I believe that project-based learning is the
best way to do it, and it is even more exciting when the concept is cool, right?
Opportunities of a programmer are endless! So what are we waiting for? Let's start
our journey and make your personal story in this fantastic and brilliant world of
programming!😀
